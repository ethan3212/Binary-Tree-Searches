# Binary-Tree-Searches

This program inserts, stores, and deletes numbers in a binary tree. It will also traverse the tree in three ways and display the results: pre-order, in-order, and post-order.
In this case, the numbers are: 1, 2, 7, 3, 5, 10, and 8; which will be the pre-order. In-order traversal will show: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 10. Post-order traversal will show: 5, 3, 8, 10, 7, 2, and 1.
